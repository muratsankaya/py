def custom_transform(data):
    """
    Transform the `spiral.csv` data such that it can be more easily classified.

    To pass test_custom_transform_hard, your transformation should create at
    most three features and should allow a LogisticRegression model to achieve
    at least 90% accuracy.

    You can use free_response.q2.visualize_spiral() to visualize the spiral
    as we give it to you, and free_response.q2.visualize_transform() to
    visualize the 3D data transformation you implement here.

    Args:
        data: a Nx2 matrix from the `spiral.csv` dataset.

    Returns:
        A transformed data matrix that is (more) easily classified.
