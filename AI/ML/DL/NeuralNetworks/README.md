# Neural Networks

#### This project includes:

- Implementation of Sigmoid and ReLU activation functions

- Loss function implementations of Binary Cross Entropy Loss and Squared Loss to be used for a Fully Connected Multilayer Perceptron Model.

- A Fully Connected Multilayer Perceptron Model implementation. 

- A Binary Perceptron Classifier Implementation. 

- A Regularizer Implementation to be used as a penalty term for a loss function.
